Here's a short description of the number guessing game:

The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player attempts to guess it. After each guess, feedback is given: "too high," "too low," or "correct." The game repeats until the player guesses the number or runs out of limited attempts. Multiple rounds are available, allowing the player to keep playing, with scores based on attempts taken or rounds won.
